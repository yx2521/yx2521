## Hi! I am Yilan

I'm a fresh Cambridge data science graduate currently seeking technical opportunities in London and available to start immediately.


## My Journey

I completed a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry at Imperial College London (2021–2024). From analysing data in the lab to developing an interactive VR multiplayer chemistry game in Unity, I saw how powerful computational tools can be. I also realised that much of today’s exciting progress in science comes from the strategic use of data, AI, and well-designed software.

I wanted to contribute to data-driven innovation beyond the chemistry lab. This motivation led me to pursue the MPhil in Data Intensive Science at the University of Cambridge (2024–2025), where I built expertise in statistical modelling, machine learning, and software engineering.
